Linear Regression is simple to implement.
In Decision Tree Regression, small change in the data cause a big difference in the tree structure.
SVM is not suitable for large datasets.
Ridge Regression include all the predictors in the final model and shrink the coefficients towards zero.
Lasso Regression will select only one feature from a group of included features and it is a shrinker model.
usage of Lasso model is better if the model is linear.
